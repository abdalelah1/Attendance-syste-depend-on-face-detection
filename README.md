# Attendance Management System Using Face Recognition

Welcome to the Attendance Management System project, designed to enhance student attendance tracking through cutting-edge artificial intelligence technologies. Our advanced system integrates face recognition technology with One-Shot Learning to deliver a seamless and efficient attendance management experience. This README provides comprehensive details on setting up, using, and understanding the core features of the system.

## üí° Overview

The Attendance Management System is an innovative solution that leverages face recognition for automatic student attendance recording. Utilizing One-Shot Learning, the system ensures high accuracy in student identification with minimal data requirements, making attendance tracking more efficient and reliable.

## üöÄ Features

### One-Shot Learning
- **Single Image Training**: The system employs One-Shot Learning to recognize students using just one image for training. This technology enables high accuracy in face recognition with minimal data input.

### Real-Time Attendance Updates
- **Automatic Updates**: As soon as a student is recognized, their attendance is automatically recorded for the respective course and week, minimizing manual intervention and reducing human errors.

### Teacher Dashboard
- **Detailed Reports**: Provides educators with a user-friendly interface to view comprehensive reports on attendance, including lists of enrolled, warned, and deprived students based on their attendance percentages.

### Automatic Attendance Logging
- **Efficient Logging**: Attendance is recorded automatically when a student is identified, eliminating manual logging and streamlining the process.

### Accurate Reports and Statistics
- **Detailed Analytics**: Offers precise reports on attendance rates, absences, and delays for each student, assisting teachers and administrators in making informed decisions.

### Absence Percentage Calculation
- **Course-Specific Calculations**: The system calculates absence percentages based on the type of course (theoretical or practical), providing accurate assessments tailored to course requirements.

### Targeted Management for Theoretical and Practical Courses
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Designed for theoretical course professors and practical course instructors, allowing them to manage and review attendance data specific to their courses.

### Warnings and Deprivation Management
- **Automated Warnings**: Monitors attendance percentages and issues warnings to students exceeding permissible absence limits. Persistent absences without justification result in deprivation from the course.
